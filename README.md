# Welcome to the Data Science (DS) repository!
This repo contains a collection of practicals related to core Data Science concepts. 
It's designed to be clean, beginner-friendly, and easy to navigate—perfect for students, learners, and anyone who wants to revise DS fundamentals with working code.

# 🚀 What's Inside?
You'll find implementations of the most essential data science such as:
Data Frames and Basic Data Pre-processing
Data Visualization and Storytelling
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Feature Scaling and Dummification
Hypothesis Testing
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) etc.
Each practical is placed inside its own folder/file to keep things simple and clear.

# 🎯 Goal of This Repository
This repository aims to:
Help understand DS concepts through code
Provide clean and easy-to-read implementations
Encourage hands-on practice and experimentation
